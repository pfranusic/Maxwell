\section{Electromagnetism in science and technology}

It is amazing to consider that the amber and lodestone effects
were the only phenomena known to the Greeks in which the effects
of electricity or magnetism were apparent.
But when the understanding of electromagnetism developed,
technologies appeared that defied imagination:
telegraphy, telephony, hydroelectric power, television.

Ten thousand years from now \ldots the most significant event of the 19th century
will be judged as Maxwell's discovery of the laws of electrodynamics.
