\section{Remarks on vector equations}

In the preceding section we derived a formula for the potential $\phi$ of an electric dipole.
The strategy was twofold.
First we chose the Cartesian axes in such a way that made the subsequent derivation easy.
Then we transformed the resulting Cartesian equation into a vector equation.
The result was a formula that doesn't depend on any coordinate system.

Sometimes it helps to expand terse expressions and write out the various components.
For example, $\grad\cdot\bv{E}$ can be expanded to
%% nonumber
\begin{equation*}
  \dfdx{E_x}{x} + \dfdx{E_y}{y} + \dfdx{E_z}{z}
\end{equation*}
