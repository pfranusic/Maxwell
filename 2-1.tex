\section{Understanding physics}

The physicist needs a facility in looking at problems from several points of view.
Ideas such as the field lines, capacitance, resistance, and inductance are,
for such purposes, very useful.
On the other hand, none of the heuristic models, such as field lines,
is really adequate and accurate for all situations.
There is only one precise way of presenting the laws,
and that is by means of differential equations.

It will take you some time to understand what should happen in different situations.
You will have to solve the equations.
Each time you solve the equations, 
you will learn something about the character of the solutions.
To keep these solutions in mind, it will be useful also 
to study their meaning in terms of field lines and of other concepts.
This is the way you will really ``understand'' the equations.

What it means really to understand an equation ---
that is, in more than a strictly mathematical sense ---
was described by Dirac.  He said:
``I understand what an equation means if I have a way of figuring out 
the characteristics of its solution without actually solving it.''
A physical understanding is a completely unmathematical, imprecise, and inexact thing,
but absolutely necessary for a physicist.
